# [setup.sh - opinionated environment settings for Bash](https://github.com/jerrygreen/setup.sh)

The idea is to have some shared rc files across systems, easily updatable.

## Install / Usage

```bash
curl -sL https://x.jerrygreen.me/setup.sh | bash
```

This will create [`~/.rc`](https://github.com/jerrygreen/setup.sh/tree/master/.rc) folder with opinionated environmental settings, which are applied automatically. It installs the most recent version, can be safely re-run as many times as you need.
