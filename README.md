# setup.sh - setup bash environment

I made it for personal use to quickly setup my bash environment. I made this repo public so it's available without any auth. Feel free to fork it and make it suit your needs.

The idea is to setup files like `.bashrc` on new systems, because if I loose them, I loose many handy settings.
I made it to support at least macos and windows. Hopefully it's somewhat close to work on linux too.

## Requirements

windows:

- [Git, Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

macos:

- none :)

linux:

- ???

## Usage

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.github.com/JerryGreen/setup.sh/master/setup.sh | bash
```
