# setup.sh - setup bash environment

The idea is to have some shared `.bashrc` settings across systems, and also useful if I want to make a fresh OS install.

I made it to support at least macos and windows. Hopefully it's somewhat close to work on linux too.

## Requirements

windows:

- [Git, Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

macos:

- none :)

linux:

- ???

## Usage

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.github.com/JerryGreen/setup.sh/master/setup.sh | bash
```
